# The prayer on the water follows:
`O God, the Eternal Father, ` <br />
`we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, ` <br />
`to bless and sanctify this [water] to the souls of all those who drink of it, ` <br />
`that they may do it in remembrance of the blood of thy Son, ` <br />
`which was shed for them; ` <br />
`that they may witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, ` <br />
`that they do always remember him, ` <br />
`that they may have his Spirit to be with them. Amen ` <br />
 <br />
`( D&C 20:79 & Moroni 5 )`
