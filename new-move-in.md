# New Move-In (Membership Records Sustaining)
We have received the membership records for the following members who have moved into our ward. As we read your name, please stand and remain standing until all names have been read.

All those who can join with the bishopric in welcoming these new members may manifest it by the uplifted hand. Thank you.
