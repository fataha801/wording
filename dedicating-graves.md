# Dedicating Graveside Prayer
A person who dedicates a grave must hold the Melchizedek Priesthood and must be authorized by the priesthood officer who conducts the service.

To dedicate a grave, he:
- [x] Addresses Heavenly Father.
- [x] States that he is dedicating the grave by the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood.
- [x] Dedicates and consecrates the burial plot as the resting place for the body of the deceased.
- [x] Where appropriate, prays that the place will be hallowed and protected until the Resurrection.
- [x] Asks the Lord to comfort the family and expresses other thoughts as the Spirit directs.
- [x] Closes in the name of Jesus Christ.

If the family prefers, a person (preferably a man who holds the Melchizedek Priesthood) may offer a graveside prayer rather than a dedicatory prayer.
