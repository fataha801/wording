# Sealing the Anointing
Normally, two or more men who hold the Melchizedek Priesthood place their hands lightly on the head of the person who is sick. One of the men seals the anointing. To do so, he:
- [ ] Calls the person by his or her full name
- [ ] States that he is sealing the anointing by the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood
- [ ] Gives a blessing as the Spirit directs
- [ ] Closes in the name of Jesus Christ
