# Personal Interview
President Eyring teaches that as we listen to the sacrament prayers, we can feel like we are having a personal interview with God. President Eyring thinks of the following three areas. Consider writing these questions in your journal and pondering them each Sunday this month. As you ponder and receive impressions from the Holy Ghost, you can also write about those in your journal.
+ What have I done that has pleased God?
+ What do I need to repent of or ask forgiveness for?
+ Whom would God like me to serve?
