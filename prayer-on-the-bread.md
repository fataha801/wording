# The prayer on the bread follows:
`O God, the Eternal Father,` <br>
`we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ,` <br>
`to bless and sanctify this bread` <br>
`to the souls of all those who partake of it,` <br>
`that they may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son,` <br>
`and witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father,` <br>
`that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son,` <br>
`and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them;` <br>
`that they may always have his Spirit to be with them. Amen`<br>
<br>
`[ D&C 20:77 & Moroni 4 ]`
