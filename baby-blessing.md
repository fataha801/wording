# babyblessing

Children are normally named and blessed during fast and testimony meeting in the ward where the parents are members of record. Blessing can be done in the home. Let's have a Bishopric member present at the baby blessing. The ordinance of naming and blessing children requires authorization from the presiding authority.
When blessing a baby, Melchizedek Priesthood holders gather in a circle and place their hands under the baby. When blessing an older child, brethren place their hands lightly on the childâ€™s head. The person who gives the blessing:
Addresses Heavenly Father.

States that the blessing is performed by the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood.

Gives the child a name.

Gives words of blessing as the Spirit directs.

Closes in the name of Jesus Christ.
